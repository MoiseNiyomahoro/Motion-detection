Motion Detector System 🚨
📘 Overview
A simple embedded system that detects motion using a PIR sensor and alerts the user through an LCD display, LEDs, and a buzzer. The project is built on an Arduino Uno and includes a Proteus simulation demo.
🎯 Features
Motion detection using PIR sensor
LCD screen displays system status
Red LED for motion detected
Green LED for no motion
Buzzer alarm when motion is detected
Proteus simulation included
🧰 Components

Arduino Uno
PIR Sensor
16x2 LCD Display
Buzzer
Red LED & Green LED
Resistors, jumper wires, breadboard

⚙️ How It Works
When no motion is detected:
🟢 Green LED ON, 🔕 buzzer OFF, LCD shows “No Motion Detected”
When motion is detected:
🔴 Red LED ON, 🔊 buzzer ON, LCD shows “Motion Detected!”
